## Meet Elixa
Code glitches got you down? [Elixa Duxworth](http://www.elixa.io/) is a friendly troubleshooting partner who is always ready to listen! Even when her suggestions are not exactly on point, sometimes just chatting through troubleshooting woes can help.  Elixa figures she as least as good of a troubleshooting partner as a [rubber duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).  And when a bug has you really stuck, what have you got to lose?

Elixa's friendly attitude, familiar chat interface, and constant availability makes her an appealing option for anyone who needs to talk through a thorny coding problem.  Her technical tips are based on the learning experiences of many software bootcamp students and instructors. Elixa's advice includes targeted responses at the mention of specific technologies, as well as general programming wisdom.  And if the conversation strays off the topic of programming, she is always happy to just chat!

## History and Inspiration

Elixa Duxworth is the evolution of my earlier project, [Elixa Newpal]http://www.elixa.io/denver-love), which was developed as an appreciative gift to the incredible learning community of the Flatiron Software Engineering Bootcamp in Denver, CO, affectionately known as "The Love Bubble" or "The Learning Factory".  

That orginal Elixa Newpal program is based on ELIZA, an early natural language processing computer program developed in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. ELIZA simulated conversation by using a pattern matching and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program. Interactions were dictated by "scripts" which allowed ELIZA to process user inputs and engage in discourse following the rules and directions of the script. The most famous script, DOCTOR, simulated a psychotherapist by using script rules to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. ELIZA was one of the first ever chatbots and one of the first programs capable of attempting the Turing test.

The Elixa Newpal code is based on a 2005 [ELIZA Javascript implementation](https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/) by [Norbert Landsteiner of mass:werk media](https://www.masswerk.at/).

## Status and Future Plans

Future features under consideration:
* Improvment of the keyword memory feature so that Elixa will "remember" specific technologies mentioned earlier in the conversation and be able to persist some context
* Addition of an autosearch feature where Elixa will present the user with Google searches based on combinations of keywords
* An SMS interface
* An official Slackbot integration
* A significant refactor of the code

## Contact

Hi! My name is Tara Harwood, and I am the developer of Elixa Duxworth and the Founder/ Chief Hobbyist of [elixa.io](https://elixa.io/), which is my brand for volunteer contributions to open-source projects and chatbot research activities.  I have a specific interest in natural language processing, SMS applications, and technologies related to political activism.

As a child, my first personal computer came with the BASIC version of ELIZA, and from the start I was entranced with her.  My early positive experiences with ELIZA formed my interest in computer programming and influenced my ideas about interaction design.

As of May 2021, I am a student at Flatiron School's Full-Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp in Denver, CO. I created Elixa Duxworth as the capstone project to my 15 week curriculum. I will be graduating on May 14 2021. You can learn more about / contact me on LinkedIn or GitHub:
